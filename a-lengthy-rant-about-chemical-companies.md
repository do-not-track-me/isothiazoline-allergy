MI was awarded as the Contact Allergen of the Year 2013, and is now [the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis](https://www.occderm.asn.au/health-professionals/epidemic-of-allergy-to-preservative-methylisothiazolinone-mi/) in our patient population, and has been referred to as a "contact allergen epidemic".

The situation has gotten worse after Parabens somehow got themselves a bad reputation, even though they are far less likely to cause allergies. So more manufacturers have switched to MI-like chemicals.

## So why is this even legal?
Some time in 1990, the nice people at chemical companies published this study, claiming that MI is perfectly safe and nothing to worry about. When looking more closely at the study though, there is a clear gap in the test data. TODO: find the link

Some years later, this (TODO: add link) canadian study filled in that gap, and found that with enough cumulative exposure over a lifetime, nearly everyone will develop allergies eventually.
Still even though there has been a mountain of studies that bring up the concerns of this product, it has remained legal for now.

Luckily, the EU eventually added some [stricter regulations](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/legislation_en) in 2017, banning this product from *leave-on* cometic products.

.. which is great, but that still leaves all other products that do still come into skin contact.
.. and many similar enough products that don't fall within the regulated substance list (kinda like designer drugs, it's relatively easy for the chemical company to just modify the substance a bit and then continue using it)

The cogs of bureaucracy also move very slowly, and any EU regulation can take years to affect produts sold on store shelves.
Decreasing the overall exposure to these substances is definitely great, but for people that are already sensitized, this may not be enough.
