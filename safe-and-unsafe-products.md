# List of safe products :)
Here is a list of products used for various purposes that i've found mostly okay


## Detergent
- the non-liquid version of [marseille soap](https://www.ruohonjuuri.fi/collections/marius-fabre/products/marius-fabre-marseille-saippua-400-g) (these are also sold as flakes)
- If some liquid detergent has to be used, [LV Color](https://www.lv.fi/product/lv-color-pyykinpesuneste/) is probably the least bad one.

## Wool detergent
- [Sonett Villan ja silkin pesuaine, hajustamaton, 1 l](https://www.ruohonjuuri.fi/products/sonett-villan-ja-silkin-pesuaine-hajustamaton-1-l) (probably ok)

- various air fresheners (many of these actually contain quite dodgy stuff)

There are probably countless other products, but these are just the ones i have come across
