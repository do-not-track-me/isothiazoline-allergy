# List of safe products :)
Here is a list of products used for various purposes that i've found mostly okay


## Detergent
- the non-liquid version of [marseille soap](https://www.ruohonjuuri.fi/collections/marius-fabre/products/marius-fabre-marseille-saippua-400-g) (these are also sold as flakes)
- If some liquid detergent has to be used, [LV Color](https://www.lv.fi/product/lv-color-pyykinpesuneste/) is probably the least bad one.

## Wool detergent
- [Sonett Villan ja silkin pesuaine, hajustamaton, 1 l](https://www.ruohonjuuri.fi/products/sonett-villan-ja-silkin-pesuaine-hajustamaton-1-l) (probably ok)

## Clothes misc

## Cleaning surfaces at home
- Marseille soap
- diluted vinegar

## Stains
- [Baking/washing soda](https://www.ruohonjuuri.fi/products/marius-fabre-ruokasooda-puhdistukseen-700-g)

# List of known bad products >:|
Avoid at all cost! (There are probably countless other products, but these are just the ones i have come across)

## Brands which i found most products contain MI-like preservatives
- Omo (various products, especially liquid ones) (MI/MCI in large quantities)
- Bio Luvil (most products contain MI *and* OIT)
- Tolu (most products i checked contain MI & BIT)
- Pledge (MI/MCI)
- Softcare (at least wool and leather cleaning products) (BIT & MI)

## specific products that i've checked
- Havu Mäntysuopa (at least liquid versions) (MIT and BIT, probably large quantities) (this was a bit of a surprise since it's kind of marketed as a natural product.) i even found [a report of it affecting pets](https://www.iltalehti.fi/kotimaa/a/b78562ab-8c6f-4efd-9d37-2e77db676e31)
- Suma Rapid D6 (window cleaning spray) (BIT)
- Extreme stain and odour remover (for pet stains) (BIT)

# these have caused a reaction, but i haven't confirmed the specific chemical
- Products containing perfume
- Most fabric softeners
- minirisk liquid products
- ecover liquid products
- vanish products
- various air fresheners (some of these actually contain quite dodgy stuff)
