# Hiya!

So I have a [contact allergy](https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/skin-sensitising-chemicals) to this chemical group called

* [isothiazolines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothiazolinone) *

, a preservative used in most liquid detergents, cleaning products, etc.

(I have pasted you this link since it's pretty tedious to explain a somewhat complex subject repeatedly to everyone)

# What this means in practice

Any contact with surfaces (even trace amounts) that have been cleaned with a product containing this preservative, will cause very uncomfortable skin irritation.

Ignoring the symptoms will not make them go away, and the only thing that helps is to take a long cold shower, wash my clothes multiple times, etc.

This is a [lifelong condition, desensitization does not work, and there is no cure](https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/skin-sensitising-chemicals). The only way to avoid symptoms, is to avoid contact to the allergen.

.. which is kind of unfortunate since [it's used practically everywhere](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy). (insert bad luck brian meme here)

# So what exactly are isothiazolines?

these names are are all a bit of a mouthful, but i guess the gist of things is that they are commonly used preservatives.
Currently the most common ones used in household cleaning products:
- Methylisothiazoline (MI)
- methylchloroisothiazoline (MCI)
- Octhilinone or octyl-isothiazoline (OIT)
- Benzisothiazolinone (BIT)
- Some fragrances might also contain these

## Other ways these substances can be mentioned
- the chemical name for example: 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one or 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one
- there are many [brand names](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy) (see chapter "alternative names") but i have not come across these in EU produtcts

To make things a bit easier though, i'll refer to the substance as MI in the rest of the page

# How can you help me / anyone else with a chemical allergy?

I don't expect people to always know which products contain MI and which don't (it's not always listed directly on the package).
It would be really helpful though, if I am planning on stopping by, to get a list of products that have been used around the house:
- cleaning products (used on any surfaces / fabrics in the house)
- detergents
- fabric softeners
and whether you have recently used any
- air fresheners
- if any walls have been painted less than 2 weeks ago

(things like hand soap don't matter, i usually just bring my own)

Either the precise name or a picture of the front and back side of the bottles should be enough for me to look them up.
- the more information i have, the easier it is for me to prepare / take the necessary precautions.

I understand if this is too much trouble, don't worry, i'm used to people sometimes not understanding. just be aware then of the chance i will need to leave soon after getting there, because i'll need to quickly go home to spend the rest of my day in the shower and probably also desperately washing my clothes.

## how to choose safer products
- Unscented products that have been allergy certified and manufactured in the EU are generally safe (i've found that products from LV are mostly ok), soaps that are sold in solid form (block soap, non-liquid detergent) generally don't need so many preservatives.
- avoid using excessive amounts of cleaning products
- however, since the chemical companies have done a good job at obscuring the actual contents of products (see chapter below "#how to find out which produts contain MI")


the rest of the page contains more detailed info and ranting that might be TLDR
# How to find out if a product contains MI?

## check the packaging
The first step is to check the packaging, it might (or might not) be mentioned as one of the ways mentioned above.

## certificates
if you find one of these on the packaging, it is probably safe
- "allergia & astmaliitto"
- "Joutsenmerkki" (not 100% sure about this)

## check the safety card
If it's not mentioned, you're still not safe! many products actually containing this don't mention it directly on the packaging. Luckily the EU has mandated that all manufacturers need to provide a [safety card](https://tukes.fi/kemikaalit/reach/kayttoturvallisuustiedote) (or käyttöturvallisuustiedote in finnish) either on their website or by request. (the Tukes page says these safety cards are [for profressionals only](https://tukes.fi/kemikaalit/reach/kayttoturvallisuustiedote), not for end users, why this information is not publicly available is a good question)

### finding the card in the kemidigi database
To make things a bit easier, there is this [chemical search page](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaalihaku) where you can search for products.
If you can find the exact product* in the search, there might** be a link to a PDF file to the "käyttöturvallisuustiedote". 
Open the PDF file and search (CTRL+F) for things like "methyl", "isoth", "oct" or "benz". If 0 results come up, the product should be safe. (It might also be mentioned in the small print towards the end of the document, so searching for keywords is te best option)
To check that the document is not super old, on the very bottom of the page it should say "tarkistettu 6.6.2022". 

** providing the safety card on this site is completely optional for companies). 
* Some companies also provide the safety sheets of only some of their products, for example [mäntysuopa in the solid form](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaali-ilmoitus/tiedot/454443/454443) is listed here along with the PDF, but the liquid form (which actually does contain BIT) is not listed here. There might also be a basic page for the product like [omo color for example](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaali-ilmoitus/tiedot/603799/609756)  but no PDF file available.

### request the card by email
If the safety card for this document can *not* be found on this website, the only option then is to look up the customer service email of the manufacturer, and request the safety sheet for that specific product. Companies are required by law to provide this document upon request within (?) days, and they don't usually take too long to reply. No additional information needs to be provided in the email, just ask for the safety card for the specific product you want to check.

## the product is bought from outside the EU
- many countries outside the EU like a majority of american and asian countries (including the US), don't have the same regulations the EU does, so it might not be possible to get a definite answer on this.

# Where is MI used?

Products that are most difficult to avoid (i.e. it's not always your own choice what products people use):
- laundry detergents and softeners
- cleaning products used to clean surfaces at home or public spaces
- some windscreen washer liquids
- recently painted walls
- air fresheners

Fabric surfaces are sometimes the worst offenders, since they might have been repeatedly sprayed with a cleaning product containing MI, and the fabric ends up absorbing larger amounts of the substance than a hard surface would. 

Since liquid (especially water based) cleaning products are easier to spoil vs ones stored in solid form, they are much more likely to contain MI, especially if the substance is not a preservative itself, and no other preservative is listed on the packaging. Products with a neutral-ish Ph are also more likely to contain MI, since it degrades in acid / alkaline solutions over time, and they don't spoil as easily anyway.

[List of product types](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy)
* the EU has banned MI from leave-on products, so things like makeups and moisturizers should be less of a concern here.

# Worst offenders
- Omo Color (also the capsules)
- liquid mäntysuopa (even though the packaging says it's 100% natural) (there's even [reports of this affecting pets](https://www.iltalehti.fi/kotimaa/a/b78562ab-8c6f-4efd-9d37-2e77db676e31) )
- 

# How many people are affected by this?

MI was awarded as the Contact Allergen of the Year 2013

MI is now [the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis](https://www.occderm.asn.au/health-professionals/epidemic-of-allergy-to-preservative-methylisothiazolinone-mi/) in our patient population, and has been called a "contact allergen epidemic"

The situation has gotten worse after Parabens somehow got themselves a bad reputation, even though they are far less likely to cause allergies. So more manufacturers have switched to MI-like chemicals.

## Why is this even legal?

Some time in 1990, the nice people at chemical companies published this study, claiming that MI is perfectly safe and nothing to worry about. When looking more closely at the study though, there is a clear gap in the test data. 

Some years later, this canadian study filled in that gap, and found that with enough cumulative exposure over a lifetime, nearly everyone will develop allergies eventually.

Still even though there has been a mountain of studies that bring up the concerns of this product, it has remained legal for now.

Luckily, the EU eventually added some [stricter regulations](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/legislation_en) in 2017, banning this product from *leave-on* cometic products.

.. which is great, but that still leaves all other products that do still come into skin contact.
.. and many similar enough products that don't fall within the regulated substance list (kinda like designer drugs, it's relatively easy for the chemical company to just modify the substance a bit and then continue using it)

The cogs of bureaucracy also move very slowly, and any EU regulation can take years to affect produts sold on store shelves.

Decreasing the overall exposure to these substances is definitely great, but for people that are already sensitized, this may not be enough.


# Tips i've found to cope with this bullshit
I'll start with the products which i've found are ok, since that list is shorter
## personal hygiene
- for washing: a solid block of marseille soap
- moisturizer: organic (food grade) coconut oil
- soothing irritated skin: organic honey as a mask, aloe vera
- skin exfoliation: salt + honey mixture
- shaving: an old school safety razor (most of the cheap plastic ones contain a small soap block)
## washing clothes
- solid marseille soap (it's also used as a bag of flakes which dilutes faster into water)
- soaking in vinegar overnight
## the clothes
so turns out all kinds of dodgy chemicals are also used in the clothes manufacturing process. Here's some stuff that has helped:
- certificates like [OEKO-TEX](https://www.oeko-tex.com/importedmedia/downloadfiles/STANDARD_100_by_OEKO-TEX_R__-_Limit_Values_and_Individual_Substances_According_to_Appendices_4___5_en.pdf) and [GOTS](https://global-standard.org/images/resource-library/documents/standard-and-manual/gots_version_6_0_en1.pdf) help, but are no silver bullet
- opt for products that have less dye
- prefer products manufactured in the EU (more regulations), and companies that provide a credible chain of manufacturing
- avoid fast fashion / cheap brands like H&M
- prefer natural products (i.e. 100% merino wool)
- you can send the manufacturer an email and just ask about their manufacturing process. if the answer is vague / they don't keep track of it, it's usually a good sign to pass on it
### Some clothes brands i've had better luck with:
- Devold's 100% merino wool products
- Finlayson's undyed 100% flax bedsheets
- Futonnetti.fi for futon mattresses
- saarentaika.com 100% organic cotton (undyed) towel
- some patagonia / black diamond products
## cleaning the house
- the same marseille soap
- diluted vinegar
- just water
- Washing soda is great for bad stains.



## other tips
- as a general rule of thumb, solid soaps need less preservatives
- when asking for product information, try to avoid phrasing the question in a way that can be taken as an attack against them. this isn't the only skeleton the chemical / cosmetics industry has in their closet, so it understandably doesn't take much for someone to get on the defensive side.
