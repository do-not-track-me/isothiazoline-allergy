# Isothiazoline contact dermatitis explained

(I have pasted you this link since it's pretty tedious to explain a somewhat complex subject repeatedly to everyone. The text is written in the context of EU / finnish legislation and common local products.  a few links are still missing but will add them soon)

So I have a [contact allergy](https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/skin-sensitising-chemicals) to this chemical group called

* [isothiazolines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothiazolinone) *

, a preservative used in most liquid detergents, cleaning products, etc.

# What this means in practice

Any contact with surfaces (even trace amounts) that have been cleaned with a product containing this preservative, will cause very uncomfortable skin irritation.

Ignoring the symptoms will not make them go away, and the only thing that helps is to take a long cold shower, wash my clothes multiple times, etc.

This is a [lifelong condition, desensitization does not work, and there is no cure](https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/skin-sensitising-chemicals). The only way to avoid symptoms, is to avoid contact to the allergen.

.. which is kind of unfortunate since [it's used practically everywhere](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy). (insert bad luck brian meme here)

# So what exactly are isothiazolines?

these names are are all a bit of a mouthful, but i guess the gist of things is that they are commonly used preservatives.
Currently the most common ones used in household cleaning products:

**Methylisothiazoline** (MI), **Methylchloroisothiazoline** (MCI), **Octhilinone** or **octyl-isothiazoline** (OIT), **Benzisothiazolinone** (BIT), and some **fragrances** might also contain these

There can be some variation in the naming, and they might also be mentioned as the chemical names, for example: 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one
- there are many [brand names](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy) (see chapter "alternative names") but i have not come across these in EU produtcts

*as a general rule of thumb, any compounds that start with methyl, oct, or has "isothial" somewhere within the word, are at least worth double checking.*


To make things a bit easier though, i'll refer to the substance as MI in the rest of the page

# How can you help me / anyone else with a chemical allergy?

I don't expect people to always know which products contain MI and which don't (it's not always listed directly on the package).
It would be really helpful though, if I am planning on stopping by, to get **a list of products** that have been used around the house:
- cleaning products (used on any surfaces / fabrics in the house)
- detergents
- fabric softeners
and whether you have recently used any
- air fresheners
- if any walls have been painted less than 2 weeks ago

(things like hand soap don't matter, i usually just bring my own)

Either the precise name or a picture of the front and back side of the bottles should be enough for me to look them up.
- the more information i have, the easier it is for me to prepare / take the necessary precautions.

I understand if this is too much trouble, don't worry, i'm used to people sometimes not understanding. just be aware then of the chance i will need to leave soon after getting there, because i'll need to quickly go home to spend the rest of my day in the shower and probably also desperately washing my clothes.

## List of known good / bad products
Here is a [list of products](https://github.com/do-not-track-me/isothiazoline-allergy/blob/main/safe-and-unsafe-products.md) I've collected of products i've ended up checking.

  
.. however, chemical companies have often done a good job at obscuring the actual contents of products (see chapter below)


# Is this just some obscure problem?

MI was awarded as the Contact Allergen of the Year 2013, and is now [the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis](https://www.occderm.asn.au/health-professionals/epidemic-of-allergy-to-preservative-methylisothiazolinone-mi/) in our patient population, and has been referred to as a "contact allergen epidemic".

The situation has gotten worse after Parabens somehow got themselves a bad reputation, even though they are far less likely to cause allergies. So more manufacturers have switched to MI-like chemicals.

## So why is this even legal?
Some time in 1990, the nice people at chemical companies published this study, claiming that MI is perfectly safe and nothing to worry about. When looking more closely at the study though, there is a clear gap in the test data. 

Some years later, this canadian study filled in that gap, and found that with enough cumulative exposure over a lifetime, nearly everyone will develop allergies eventually.
Still even though there has been a mountain of studies that bring up the concerns of this product, it has remained legal for now.

Luckily, the EU eventually added some [stricter regulations](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/legislation_en) in 2017, banning this product from *leave-on* cometic products.

.. which is great, but that still leaves all other products that do still come into skin contact.
.. and many similar enough products that don't fall within the regulated substance list (kinda like designer drugs, it's relatively easy for the chemical company to just modify the substance a bit and then continue using it)

The cogs of bureaucracy also move very slowly, and any EU regulation can take years to affect produts sold on store shelves.
Decreasing the overall exposure to these substances is definitely great, but for people that are already sensitized, this may not be enough.

# How do I find out if a product contains MI?

## check the packaging
The first step is to check the packaging, it might (or might not) be mentioned as one of the ways mentioned above.

## Look for certificates
if you find one of these on the packaging, it is more likely to be safe, but as the certificate criteria only lists MI and not any other similar compounds, like BIT, OIT, etc.
- "allergia & astmaliitto [criteria](https://www.allergia.fi/allergiatunnus/kriteerit/pesu-ja-puhdistusaineet/)
- "Joutsenmerkki" [criteria](https://joutsenmerkki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/026e_6_13_CD.pdf)

## check the safety card
If it's not mentioned, you're still not safe! many products actually containing this don't mention it directly on the packaging. Luckily the EU requires by law that all manufacturers need to provide a [safety card](https://tukes.fi/kemikaalit/reach/kayttoturvallisuustiedote) (or käyttöturvallisuustiedote in finnish) either on their website or by request, and any amounts of MI have to be mentioned there. (the Tukes page says these safety cards are [for profressionals only](https://tukes.fi/kemikaalit/reach/kayttoturvallisuustiedote), not for end users, why this information is not publicly available is a good question)

### finding the card in the kemidigi database
To make things a bit easier, there is this [chemical search page](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaalihaku) where you can search for products.
If you can find the exact product* in the search, there might** be a link to a PDF file to the "käyttöturvallisuustiedote". 
Open the PDF file and search (CTRL+F) for things like "methyl", "isoth", "oct" or "benz". If 0 results come up, the product should be safe. (It might also be mentioned in the small print towards the end of the document, so searching for keywords is te best option)
To check that the document is not super old, on the very bottom of the page it should say "tarkistettu 6.6.2022". 

** providing the safety card on this site is completely optional for companies). 
* Some companies also provide the safety sheets of only some of their products, for example [mäntysuopa in the solid form](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaali-ilmoitus/tiedot/454443/454443) is listed here along with the PDF, but the liquid form (which actually does contain BIT) is not listed here. There might also be a basic page for the product like [omo color for example](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaali-ilmoitus/tiedot/603799/609756)  but no PDF file available.

### request the card by email
If the safety card for this document can *not* be found on this website, the only option then is to look up the customer service email of the manufacturer, and request the safety sheet for that specific product. Companies are required by law to provide this document upon request within (?) days, and they don't usually take too long to reply. No additional information needs to be provided in the email, just ask for the safety card for the specific product you want to check.

## the product is bought from outside the EU
- many countries outside the EU like a majority of american and asian countries (including the US), don't have the same regulations the EU does, so it might not be possible to get a definite answer on this.

# Most difficult products to avoid
Products that are most difficult to avoid (i.e. it's not always your own choice what products people use):
- laundry detergents and softeners
- cleaning products used to clean surfaces at home or public spaces
- some windscreen washer liquids
- recently painted walls
- air fresheners

Fabric surfaces are sometimes the worst offenders, since they might have been repeatedly sprayed with a cleaning product containing MI, and the fabric ends up absorbing larger amounts of the substance than a hard surface would. 

Since liquid (especially water based) cleaning products are easier to spoil vs ones stored in solid form, they are much more likely to contain MI, especially if the substance is not a preservative itself, and no other preservative is listed on the packaging. Products with a neutral-ish Ph are also more likely to contain MI, since it degrades in acid / alkaline solutions over time, and they don't spoil as easily anyway.

[List of product types](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy)
* the EU has banned MI from leave-on products, so things like makeups and moisturizers should be less of a concern here.

# Worst offenders
- Omo Color (also the capsules)
- liquid mäntysuopa (even though the packaging says it's 100% natural) (there's even [reports of this affecting pets](https://www.iltalehti.fi/kotimaa/a/b78562ab-8c6f-4efd-9d37-2e77db676e31) )

# FAQ

"I don't use any harsh chemicals, maybe it's just psychological"
- i you need proof i haven't lost my mind, i can show the allergy patch test results, as well as a doctors note that recommends avoiding any spaces where MI has been used
"But this product says it's all natural!"
- looks can be deceiving, and i've ran into countless "100% natural" products that did end up having the substance
"But the products have to be preserved somehow!!"
- There are plenty of less harmful alternatives. 
"But things need to be cleaned!"
- If the question is, do you need to continuously expose yourself to an endless list of chemicals that modern cosmetic/cleaning products contain, the answer is no. A block of soap can be created from literally just two different substances, and has been used for thousands of years just fine, and plenty of other simple products can be used for all kinds of different purposes.
"But my clothes smell so fresh when i use this fabric softener!"
- That "fresh" smell is actually an artificial chemical smell that is added to the detergent. If you can smell it on your clothes, it means those chemicals are in your clothes, in contact with your skin 247. Actually clean clothes that haven't been soaked in some overengineered chemical soup, should smell like nothing at all.
