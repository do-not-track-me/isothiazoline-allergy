# isothiazoline allergy wiki

(I have pasted you this link since it's pretty tedious to explain a somewhat complex subject repeatedly to everyone. The text is written in the context of EU / finnish legislation and common local products.  a few links are still missing but will add them soon)

So I have a [contact allergy](https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/skin-sensitising-chemicals) to this chemical group called

* [isothiazolines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothiazolinone) *

, a preservative used in most liquid detergents, cleaning products, etc.

# What does this mean?

Any contact with surfaces that have been cleaned with a product containing this preservative (even trace amounts), will cause very uncomfortable skin irritation.

Ignoring the symptoms will not make them go away, and the only thing that helps is to somehow flush the allergen off, i.e. take a long cold shower, wash clothes multiple times, etc. (and then wait for my skin to heal)

This is a [lifelong condition, desensitization does not work, and there is no cure](https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/skin-sensitising-chemicals). The only way to avoid symptoms, is to avoid contact to the allergen.

.. which is kind of unfortunate since [it's used practically everywhere](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy). (insert bad luck brian meme here)

.. and to make things worse, these substances are not always mentioned on the packaging. see [this guide](https://github.com/do-not-track-me/isothiazoline-allergy/blob/main/how-to-check-for-mi.md) how to make sure

# So what exactly are isothiazolines?

The gist of things is that they are commonly used preservatives. With an emphasis on common. Currently the most common ones used in household cleaning products:

**Methylisothiazoline** (MI), **Methylchloroisothiazoline** (MCI), **Octhilinone** or **octyl-isothiazoline** (OIT), **Benzisothiazolinone** (BIT), and some **fragrances** might also contain these  (i know, the names are kind of of a mouthful)

There can be some variation in the naming, and they might also be mentioned as the chemical names, for example: 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.

To make things a bit easier though, i'll refer to the substance as MI in the rest of the page

# How can you help me or someone with a similar allergy?
I absolutely don't expect anyone to know which products contain MI and which don't (especially since it's not always listed on the package).

If I am planning on stopping by, I might ask you for **a list of all products** that have been used around the house:
- cleaning products used on any surfaces and fabrics
- detergents / fabric softeners
- air fresheners

*maybe recently painted walls?(?)

(things like hand soap don't matter, i will bring my own anyway)

Just the exact name of the product should be enough for me to search for it online (i got a pretty good routine on this now)

*The more information i have, the easier it is for me to prepare and take the necessary precautions.*

I understand if this is too much trouble, don't worry, i'm used to people sometimes not understanding. In any case please don't be offended if I end up having to leave soon after getting there because of this, it might be because I'll need to quickly go home to spend the rest of my day in the shower and desperately washing my clothes.

## List of known good / bad products
I put together this [list of products](https://github.com/do-not-track-me/isothiazoline-allergy/blob/main/safe-and-unsafe-products.md) that I've ended up checking.


# Is this just some obscure problem?
Unfortunately, it's not. MI was awarded as the Contact Allergen of the Year 2013, and is now [the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis](https://www.occderm.asn.au/health-professionals/epidemic-of-allergy-to-preservative-methylisothiazolinone-mi/) in our patient population, and has been referred to as a "contact allergen epidemic".

See the subpage [history and regulations](https://github.com/do-not-track-me/isothiazoline-allergy/blob/main/history-and-regulations.md) for more info.

# FAQ

> I don't use any harsh chemicals, maybe it's just psychological

*I might have lost my mind dealing with this, but I also have patch test results, as well as a doctor's note that recommends avoiding any spaces where MI is used for the foreseeable future.*

> But this product says it's all natural!

*Looks can be deceiving. I've ran into countless "100% natural" products that did end up having the substance (see my [list of products](https://github.com/do-not-track-me/isothiazoline-allergy/blob/main/safe-and-unsafe-products.md) for examples)*

> But the products have to be preserved somehow!!

*There are plenty of less harmful alternatives. They just make less money.*

> But things need to be cleaned!

*If the question is, do you need to continuously expose yourself to an endless list of chemicals that modern cosmetic/cleaning products contain without understanding what they even are, the answer is no. A block of soap can be created from literally just two different substances, and has been used for [thousands of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap#History) just fine, and plenty of other simple products can be used for all kinds of different purposes.*

> But my clothes smell so fresh when i use this fabric softener!

*That "fresh" smell is actually an artificial chemical smell that is added to the detergent. If you can smell it on your clothes, it means those chemicals are in your clothes, in contact with your skin 24/7. Actually clean clothes that haven't been soaked in some overengineered chemical soup, should smell like nothing at all.*
