MI was awarded as the Contact Allergen of the Year 2013, and is now [the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis](https://www.occderm.asn.au/health-professionals/epidemic-of-allergy-to-preservative-methylisothiazolinone-mi/) in our patient population, and has been referred to as a "contact allergen epidemic".

The situation has gotten worse after Parabens somehow got themselves a bad reputation, even though they are far less likely to cause allergies. So more manufacturers have switched to MI-like chemicals.

## So why is this even legal?
Some time in 1990, the nice people at chemical companies published this study, claiming that MI is perfectly safe and nothing to worry about. When looking more closely at the study though, there is a clear gap in the test data. 

Some years later, this canadian study filled in that gap, and found that with enough cumulative exposure over a lifetime, nearly everyone will develop allergies eventually.
Still even though there has been a mountain of studies that bring up the concerns of this product, it has remained legal for now.

Luckily, the EU eventually added some [stricter regulations](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/legislation_en) in 2017, banning this product from *leave-on* cometic products.

.. which is great, but that still leaves all other products that do still come into skin contact.
.. and many similar enough products that don't fall within the regulated substance list (kinda like designer drugs, it's relatively easy for the chemical company to just modify the substance a bit and then continue using it)

The cogs of bureaucracy also move very slowly, and any EU regulation can take years to affect produts sold on store shelves.
Decreasing the overall exposure to these substances is definitely great, but for people that are already sensitized, this may not be enough.

# Most difficult products to avoid
Products that are most difficult to avoid (i.e. it's not always your own choice what products people use):
- laundry detergents and softeners
- cleaning products used to clean surfaces at home or public spaces
- some windscreen washer liquids
- recently painted walls
- air fresheners

Fabric surfaces are sometimes the worst offenders, since they might have been repeatedly sprayed with a cleaning product containing MI, and the fabric ends up absorbing larger amounts of the substance than a hard surface would. 

Since liquid (especially water based) cleaning products are easier to spoil vs ones stored in solid form, they are much more likely to contain MI, especially if the substance is not a preservative itself, and no other preservative is listed on the packaging. Products with a neutral-ish Ph are also more likely to contain MI, since it degrades in acid / alkaline solutions over time, and they don't spoil as easily anyway.

* the EU has banned MI from leave-on products, so things like makeups and moisturizers should be less of a concern here.
