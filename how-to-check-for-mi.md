# How do I find out if a product contains MI?

## check the packaging
The first step is to check the packaging, it might (or might not) be mentioned as one of the ways mentioned above.

## Look for certificates
if you find one of these on the packaging, it is more likely to be safe, but as the certificate criteria only lists MI and not any other similar compounds, like BIT, OIT, etc.
- "allergia & astmaliitto [criteria](https://www.allergia.fi/allergiatunnus/kriteerit/pesu-ja-puhdistusaineet/)
- "Joutsenmerkki" [criteria](https://joutsenmerkki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/026e_6_13_CD.pdf)

## check the safety card
If it's not mentioned, you're still not safe! many products actually containing this don't mention it directly on the packaging. Luckily the EU requires by law that all manufacturers need to provide a [safety card](https://tukes.fi/kemikaalit/reach/kayttoturvallisuustiedote) (or käyttöturvallisuustiedote in finnish) either on their website or by request, and any amounts of MI have to be mentioned there. (the Tukes page says these safety cards are [for profressionals only](https://tukes.fi/kemikaalit/reach/kayttoturvallisuustiedote), not for end users, why this information is not publicly available is a good question)

### finding the card in the kemidigi database
To make things a bit easier, there is this [chemical search page](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaalihaku) where you can search for products.
If you can find the exact product* in the search, there might** be a link to a PDF file to the "käyttöturvallisuustiedote". 
Open the PDF file and search (CTRL+F) for things like "methyl", "isoth", "oct" or "benz". If 0 results come up, the product should be safe. (It might also be mentioned in the small print towards the end of the document, so searching for keywords is te best option)
To check that the document is not super old, on the very bottom of the page it should say "tarkistettu 6.6.2022". 

** providing the safety card on this site is completely optional for companies). 
* Some companies also provide the safety sheets of only some of their products, for example [mäntysuopa in the solid form](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaali-ilmoitus/tiedot/454443/454443) is listed here along with the PDF, but the liquid form (which actually does contain BIT) is not listed here. There might also be a basic page for the product like [omo color for example](https://www.kemidigi.fi/kemikaali-ilmoitus/tiedot/603799/609756)  but no PDF file available.

### request the card by email
If the safety card for this document can *not* be found on this website, the only option then is to look up the customer service email of the manufacturer, and request the safety sheet for that specific product. Companies are required by law to provide this document upon request within (?) days, and they don't usually take too long to reply. No additional information needs to be provided in the email, just ask for the safety card for the specific product you want to check.

## the product is bought from outside the EU
- many countries outside the EU like a majority of american and asian countries (including the US), don't have the same regulations the EU does, so it might not be possible to get a definite answer on this.
