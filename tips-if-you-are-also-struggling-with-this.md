On the [previous page](https://github.com/do-not-track-me/isothiazoline-allergy/blob/main/README.md) I went through some generally useful info about what MI allergy is, and how others can help make life a bit easier.

If you are actually dealing with this same bullshit though, here is some stuff i've found useful

# general tips
I'll start with the products which i've found are ok, since that list is shorter
## personal hygiene
- for washing: a solid block of marseille soap
- moisturizer: organic (food grade) coconut oil
- soothing irritated skin: organic honey as a mask, aloe vera
- skin exfoliation: salt + honey mixture
- shaving: an old school safety razor (most of the cheap plastic ones contain a small soap block)
## washing clothes
- solid marseille soap (it's also used as a bag of flakes which dilutes faster into water)
- soaking in vinegar overnight
## the clothes
so turns out all kinds of dodgy chemicals are also used in the clothes manufacturing process. Here's some stuff that has helped:
- certificates like [OEKO-TEX](https://www.oeko-tex.com/importedmedia/downloadfiles/STANDARD_100_by_OEKO-TEX_R__-_Limit_Values_and_Individual_Substances_According_to_Appendices_4___5_en.pdf) and [GOTS](https://global-standard.org/images/resource-library/documents/standard-and-manual/gots_version_6_0_en1.pdf) help, but are no silver bullet
- opt for products that have less dye
- prefer products manufactured in the EU (more regulations), and companies that provide a credible chain of manufacturing
- avoid fast fashion / cheap brands like H&M
- prefer natural products (i.e. 100% merino wool)
- you can send the manufacturer an email and just ask about their manufacturing process. if the answer is vague / they don't keep track of it, it's usually a good sign to pass on it
### Some clothes brands i've had better luck with:
- Devold's 100% merino wool products
- Finlayson's undyed 100% flax bedsheets
- Futonnetti.fi for futon mattresses
- saarentaika.com 100% organic cotton (undyed) towel
- some patagonia / black diamond products
## cleaning the house
- the same marseille soap
- diluted vinegar
- just water
- Washing soda is great for bad stains.

## other tips
- as a general rule of thumb, solid soaps need less preservatives
- when inquiring for product information, try to phrase the question in a neutral manner, as mentioned in the previous page, these allergies should not come as a surprise so it understandably doesn't take much for someone to take a defensive side on things.
- even though MI has a fairly long half life (it is a preservative after all), it is possible to speed up this process by exposing it to acidic or alkaline conditions, (heat and uv radiation also helps) for an extended period of time (iirc alkaline might be slightly more effective, but then again that is worse for your skin so just be careful and be mindful of neutralizing things first)
- I found some studies indicating that Glutathione is particularly good at neutralizing MI. 

# where to find information
- someone actually wrote a book about it! (Living with Methylisothiazolinone Allergy: The Complete Guide)[https://www.amazon.com/Living-Methylisothiazolinone-Allergy-Complete-Guide-ebook/dp/B07KV43FB6). There is a lot of useful information in here.
- google scholar is pretty good for finding studies
